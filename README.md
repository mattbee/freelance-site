# freelance-site

If you're reading this you probably want to know how this site is built and evidence of my skills.  Hopefully this reassures you about some of the claims made on the page at https://todayishould.com/freelance

## Technology

This site was built using the following languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (object oriented structure)
* PHP (not a lot, but just to show I know something about PHP)

The following technologies/services were used to streamline the generation of the above languages

* bower to manage the JS dependencies
* SASS (SCSS flavour)
* Gulp (compiling the SASS and using auto-prefix)
* Node (since gulp is built on node)
* Github for storing the code (as you can see)
* I used some Apache configuration in htaccess for some parts

## Deployment

As any good developer knows, there's no need to manually FTP anymore, so I deploy this site using deployhq.com, using a github hook to auto-deploy on commit.

## Favoured Programs

I use Sublime for my coding, all my code is purely hand written and kept to my own coding standards.

## Things I would have used had I had time

* Vagrant to create a local dev environment to match the live server, but not so important here as it's a simple site
* JS Lint in Gulp to minify and lint the JS, but again very little need on this work
