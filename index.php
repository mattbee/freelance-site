    <h2>Why me?</h2>

    <p>I'm not a salesman, just a developer, so this will be short.</p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>I'm a great communicator.  Be it in person, in your company chat room (Slack, HipChat etc) or over the phone, I respond politely, promptly and without confusing those that might not understand what Gulp or Apache are.</p>

    <h3>Skillset</h3>
    <p>I'm well versed in a variety of langugages and development styles (see below).  Even if it isn't something I have commercial experience in, I know what's possible and where challenges lie and how to overcome them.</p>

    <h3>Time Management</h3>
    <p>Time management is important, I know you need to keep clients happy, so I manage my time and clients well to keep everyone meeting their deadlines. If something needs more time, I'll always let you know (see communication).</p>

    <h3>Rates</h3>
    <p>I have an agency rate of Â£400 per day + VAT. If you need fixed price, we can do that if the designs and content are available to quote against - but whatever your needs, we can probably meet in the middle somehow.</p>
